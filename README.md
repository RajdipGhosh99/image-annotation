## Library Used

Konva.js is used here.

Performance: Konva utilizes the HTML5 canvas element, which provides better performance for rendering complex graphics compared to traditional DOM manipulation. This is especially useful when dealing with a large number of shapes or animations.

Documentation : Konva simplifies the process of creating and manipulating complex graphics by providing a high-level API for drawing shapes, applying transformations, handling events, and managing animations. This makes it easier for developers to create interactive and visually appealing graphics in Angular applications.

Rich Feature Set: Konva offers a rich set of features for creating complex graphics, including support for shapes, images, text, transformations, animations, filters, and more. This allows developers to create a wide range of visual effects and interactive elements in their Angular applications.
